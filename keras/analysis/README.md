# Analysis

The analysis compares the GAN generated images to G4 data events. All of the scripts in this section, takes a sample of G4 events and then generate GAN events with similar input conditions (primary particle energy / primary particleincident  angle). Where events are selected in bins: the primary energy bins have a +/- 5 GeV tolerance and the incident angle bins have a tolerance of +/- 0.1 rad (5.73 degree). The utils directory contains a set of files with frequently used utility functions. Following is a description and a set of instructions for all scripts in this folder:
